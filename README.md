# progress

My goal with this project was to create a command line utility that could track
your daily progress towards a goal by simply recording whether or not you put in
any time that day. I also used it to play with data serialization (it doesn't
use a database like better designed programs do).

Progress has several commands:
* help
* add [task]
* remove [task]
* complete [task]
* uncomplete [task]
* show [task]
* log [task] <task> <task>

It is not most useful thing, and I've found my todo app on my phone to be a lot
more helpful. As a result, this project is orphaned and may have some bugs.
