# progress

Originally a command line tool to incentivize daily progress towards a goal. I also used this project to mess around with writing straight bytes to the disk instead of plain text.

Progress has several commands:
* help
* add [task]
* remove [task]
* complete [task]
* uncomplete [task]
* show [task]
* log [task] <task> <task>

Honestly not the most useful thing. Perhaps better relegated to a todo program on your phone. I believe it segfaults if you ask for information about a task that doesn't exist.
